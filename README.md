# MNet
## MNet_inserted_into_nnUNet
The proposed MNet is trained with nnUNet framework, thus we provide the whole modified nnUNet project.

## MNet_pure
We also provide the pure version of MNet. This is recommended if you would like to insert MNet into your own training framework. 

MNet implemented with MindSpore (https://www.mindspore.cn/) will available soon.
